# WebGL Final Project - Interactive 3D Scene Selector (Ozzie's Morning Choice)

> PS: PLEASE RELOAD EACH PAGE as you navigate  

## The Idea

I wanted to create something that was connected to my experience rather than just a technical demo. The concept of a "magical portal system" came from wanting to showcase multiple scenes while keeping everything connected and cohesive. I thought about how i make the decision to get up every morning and do my stuff ("or fight my battles") or some days I am burnt out and stay in bed, and wanted to add a same sense of wonder and discovery to that.

Originally, I planned to have 4-5 different scenes, but I quickly realized that quality over quantity was the way to go.

## What I Tried to Achieve

### Technical Goals
- **60fps** - This was on first page load is always low but okay it quickly goes to 59-61 FPS
- **Realistic lighting** - I wanted shadows that actually look good, not just "technically correct"
- **Smooth animations** - Everything should feel fluid and responsive
- **Custom shaders** - I wanted to create effects that you can't get with standard materials

## What Actually Happened üòÖ

### The Good Stuff
- **Shaders worked out great!** The portal spiral effect was actually easier than I expected once I understood how vertex/fragment shaders work together
- **HDRI lighting** - The environment reflection (in scene selector page) made everything look so much better
- **GUI controls** - Adding real-time controls was super fun and really helped with fine-tuning
- **Performance optimization** - I'm actually proud of how well it runs 

### The Challenges  
- **Page reload** - To be honest I still don't even know which is my proper scene with the effects I added, before or after reload. But the scenes for the room and dungeon have this issue where they are different on first click vs after you reload  
- **Shadows were a nightmare** - I spent way too much time trying to get shadows done as intended. I was trying stuff along the lines of liek: 
```javascript
// Selective shadow casting - only important objects cast shadows
          const shouldCastShadow = child.name.includes('Object_') || 
                                  child.name.includes('Wall') || 
                                  child.name.includes('Floor') ||
                                  child.name.includes('Bed') ||
                                  child.name.includes('Table') ||
                                  child.name.includes('Chair') ||
                                  child.name.includes('Cabinet');
          
          const shouldReceiveShadow = child.name.includes('Floor') || 
                                    child.name.includes('Wall') ||
                                    child.name.includes('Ground');
          
          child.castShadow = shouldCastShadow;
          child.receiveShadow = shouldReceiveShadow;
```   
but then all shadows stopped showing. So I gave up
- **Model optimization** - The original models were not huge (just like several `kb` each). But one was liek 9MB and I tried to compress or reduce polygon count while keeping visual quality. but I thoguht that only one model being kinda large works for the project. It dind't have that many vertex count  
- **Post-processing** - I wanted to add more effects like depth of field and motion blur, but frames dropped, just slightly but more of, for my concept a lot of post processing looked meh. Also, I tried making the bloom effect   

### What I Had to Compromise On
- **More scenes** - Originally wanted 4-5 scenes, but quality over quantity won out  
- **Post-processing** - Chose to stick with bloom and gradient effects instead of more complex chains

## Technical Decisions & Why

### Why HDRI + Directional Light?
I tried using just HDRI at first, but the lighting was too flat. Adding a directional light gave me shadows and highlights that made everything pop.  

### Why Custom Shaders?
I could have used standard materials, but I wanted the portals to feel magical. The spiral effect with aberration was inspired by sci-fi movies. It's not just visual - it actually responds to mouse movement, which makes it feel interactive.

### Why GSAP for Animations?
I tried using Three.js's built-in animation system, but GSAP is just so much easier for complex sequences. The portal transitions feel a bit smoother.

## What I'm Proud Of ‚ú®

- **The portal effect** - It actually looks magical and responds to interaction
- **Performance** - Getting 60fps while keeping visual quality
- **Atmospheric lighting** - The scenes actually feel like different environments ALSO the gradient and sky effect!
- **Smooth transitions** - Everything flows together nicely
- **GUI system** - Being able to tweak everything in real-time is super useful

## What I'd Do Differently Next Time

- **Get inspiration faster somehow** - I spent too much time on thinking of the concept
- **Use Draco compression** - Could have saved more file size with geometry compression

## The Bottom Line

This project taught me that 3D web experiences are all about balance. You can't have everything - you have to choose what's most important for your vision and optimize around that. I'm happy with how it turned out, even though it's not exactly what I originally planned. Sometimes the best projects are the ones that evolve based on what you learn along the way.
